# Diabet prediction with FastApi

In this project, I trained exploratory data analysis using the diabetes dataset and a machine learning model using this analysis. I used LightGBM Classifier as the model. Then I deployed the model with FastApi.


## How to use
After downloading the code file, follow the steps below to run it on localhost:

1-Go to the directory where you downloaded the code file from the terminal.

2-Enter "python main.py" command.

3- When the code works, enter the url "http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs" in the search bar in your browser.

4- After clicking the "/predict" tab, enter the desired values and click the "Execute" button.

NOTE!!

While entering the input values, enter the value of only one of the variables BMI_araligi, yas_araligi and INSULIN_araligi as 1 and the others as 0.
